I would have names it readme but....I don't knwo i hope you like it this way.
I dojnt Know which DB you will like to use But you can fix that using a nuget package and in the startup.CS,
I commented it there
There are 7 tables in all.
All models have there Primary Key and PharmBranch has a Fk
But i would have loved to inherit Pharmacy From PharmBranch but i just thought it would be safer for Unit testing.
The default routing is Index. You know that :)
And how do i get paid?
Thanks #peace
